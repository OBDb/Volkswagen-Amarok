## Generations

The Volkswagen Amarok has gone through three distinct generations since its introduction:

- **First Generation (2010-2022)**: The original Amarok was introduced as Volkswagen's first mid-size pickup truck. It featured a robust chassis, all-wheel drive capabilities, and a range of diesel engines (primarily 2.0L TDI and 3.0L V6 TDI). Known for its car-like handling with pickup utility, the first-generation Amarok offered payloads of up to 1 tonne and was available in single and double cab configurations. It received a significant facelift in 2016, introducing the more powerful V6 engines and updated technology features.

- **Second Generation (2022-present)**: Developed in partnership with Ford, the second-generation Amarok shares its platform with the Ford Ranger but maintains Volkswagen's design language and character. This generation features increased dimensions, improved off-road capabilities, and more sophisticated technology. Engine options include various diesel powertrains ranging from 2.0L four-cylinder to 3.0L V6 units, with some markets also receiving a 2.3L EcoBoost petrol engine. The second generation offers enhanced towing capabilities, advanced driver assistance systems, and a more premium interior compared to its predecessor.
